## How it works

The project multiplies two 8 bit signed numbers and generates a 16 bit product using Modified Booth Multiplier Algorithm


## How to test

Two 8-bit signed numbers are fed as input to the multiplier, the multiplier bits are recoded and fed to a dadda multiplier design and the corresponding outputs are added in a carry lookahead adder to get the final 32 bit product

## External hardware
